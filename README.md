# cassandra-toolkit
A curated + created set of the best and most useful Cassandra / Cassandra compatible tools for setting up, administering, configuring clusters. Initially started to curate tools related to Visualizing Cassandra cluster related things. Now being used as a place to give people one repository to pull down and start working with these tools. Maintained by Rahul Singh of [Anant](http://anant.us). Feel free contact me if you'd like to collaborate on this and other tools. I also work on [Cassandra.Link](http://cassandra.link), a curated set of knowledge on all things related to Cassandra. Please take a look!
